      <rdfs:label>Financial Industry Business Ontology</rdfs:label>
      <dct:abstract>The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) is a collaborative effort among industry practitioners, semantic technology experts and information scientists to standardize the language used to precisely define the terms, conditions, and characteristics of financial instruments; the legal and relationship structure of business entities; the content and time dimensions of market data; and the legal obligations and process aspects of corporate actions.  The definitions and relationships that comprise the FIBO specification have been modularized into a number of domains, which in turn include a number of modules, each of which is further modularized into one or more constituent ontologies. 

The FIBO ontologies are available as OWL 2 ontologies from the EDM Council site, and as UML models that are compliant with the Semantics for Information Modeling and Federation (SMIF) draft specification, and are linked at https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/ontology/ .</dct:abstract>

The business scope of the BE ontologies covers a range of business and legal entities that are considered by financial industry firms, regulators and other industry participants to be of relevance in the financial services domain, including:
 - Legal entities generally
 - Corporate structure, ownership and control, including primary executive roles for businesses,
 - Functional entities such as governments and government entities, non-governmental organizations, international organizations, not-for-profit organization, etc.
 - Concepts specific to corporations, partnerships, private limited companies, sole proprietorships, and trusts.</dct:abstract>

This is labeled as contractually capable entity, to avoid confusion with the accepted legal term for Legal Entity. Such entities are recognized as requiring an LEI, but the identifier itself is allocated to the formal organization which is recognized as being contractually capable.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>The ownership and control module contains ontologies that define various types and aspects of ownership and control as they apply among and between business entities.  The ontologies in this module include the definition of types of party as defined in the roles of ownership and control along with the capacities which define those parties, and separately the relationships of ownership and control directly between organizations, which arise from the existence of those roles. Specific types of ownership and control relationships that are unique to incorporated companies are defined in addition to the more general terms to which these relate. Also included is an ontology of the types of control relationships that exist by virtue of the powers conferred upon corporate officers, board members and other executive roles.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>This ontology defines concepts relating to types of controlling parties. The concepts defined here are party in role concepts, which define the nature of some entity such as an organization or a legal person, in some role such as that of owning a controlling interest in the entity or of controlling that entity. These roles are defined in terms of the types of control enjoyed by the party, for example de facto or de jure control. An important feature of this ontology is the distinction between the holding of a controlling interest (such as voting shares), and the de facto existence of control of one body by another as asserted in company filings or as a conclusion drawn from computational analysis of controlling interests.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>A transaction and contract in which one leg is the conditional commitment to pay out on some debt in the event that a pre-defined credit event takes place. The contract may make reference to a specific debt instrument or loan, or take effect in the event of one of a range of events that happen to the business entity that is the debtor in that debt.

      <rdfs:label>Foundations</rdfs:label>
      <dct:abstract>The Foundations (FND) domain includes ontologies that define general purpose concepts required to support other FIBO domains. These include concepts and relationships about people, organizations, places, and most importantly, contracts that are essential to domains such as Business Entities (BE), Financial Business and Commerce (FBC), Indices and Indicators (IND), and Securities (SEC). 

The scope of the definitions provided in FND is limited to coverage of exactly those concepts needed by other FIBO specifications.  They may be useful for other domains, such as insurance, but are intentionally underspecified to avoid unintended consequences and thus do not provide exhaustive coverage for any concept contained herein.  However, Foundations is designed for growth over time.  The expectation is that as additional foundational knowledge is needed to define concepts in other FIBO domain areas, additional ontologies and/or concepts will be integrated into Foundations as required.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>This ontology defines currency and monetary amount related concepts for use in defining other FIBO ontology elements. There are two distinct kinds of concepts that correspond to money and amounts: a concrete, actual amount of money, and the monetary measure of something denominated in some currency. These are dimensionally the same but whereas 'money amount' is defined as an amount of money, 'monetary amount' is an abstract monetary measure.

The definition of currency provided herein is compliant with the definitions given in ISO 4217.  ISO 4217 provides universally applicable coded representations of names of currencies and funds, used internationally for financial transaction support.  The ontology has been partitioned into 2 parts: (1) the essential concept system describing the standard (this module), and (2) ISO4217-1-CurrencyCodes, which contains all of the individuals specified in ISO 4217.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>This ontology sets out the basic concepts of method and rule along with kinds and variations of either of these, as a basis for extensive lists of kinds of method such as accrual method, or kinds of rule such as date roll rules, throughout FIBO reference concepts. These form the bulk of the concepts that underlie the contents of extensional code lists in financial data. 
		This is intended to be a Provisional ontology not (as now) an Informative one, since the vast majority of lists of things that were once in textual code lists, are sets of methods or rules. This usage is endemic across all of the FIBO reference information universe.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>This ontology defines what it means for something to be a tool or an instrument, which I both cases is something defined in terms of its usage to some end. This is the deeper conceptual basis for concepts like capital (money with a purpose; a tool) or financial instruments in the most literal sense of that word (some contract used to achieve some investment objective). 
		This ontology is intended to be entirely conceptual, providing the disambiguation between concepts that are often conflated in natural language, and as such would almost certainly never be included in an application ontology.</dct:abstract>

The ontology defines things which are conferred upon some entity by some legal instrument, and elaborates this into a number of specific capacities, responsibilities and powers, each of which forms the basis for many of the concepts used elsewhere in FIBO in defining legal personhood, executive powers and the like.</dct:abstract>

      <rdfs:label>Legal Core Ontology</rdfs:label>
      <dct:abstract>This ontology defines high-level legal concepts for use in other FIBO ontology elements. These concepts include law and constitution, both of which are framed at a more abstract level than national or state laws and constitutions, so that law forms the basis both for statutes and for company by-laws, and constitution forms the basis both for national or state constitutions and for instruments which are constitutive of incorporated legal entities. This ontology also defines some of the variants of these such as governmental constitutions and ordinances. Other types of law are provided in the Jurisdictions ontology as extensions of concepts in this ontology. Court of Law is also defined here.</dct:abstract>

      <skos:editorialNote>The concepts in this module are intended to be replaced by concepts in the Analytics ontology in the Utilities module. This material may currently be referenced in Provisional or Extension modules elsewhere. Where possible these references will be replaced by references to substantive content in the Analytics ontology. Where the appropriate concept does not exist, the relevant concepts (classes or properties) may be added to that ontology. 

Concepts in the Amounts ontology in this module have largely been superseded by content in Accounting and are retained only for legacy model content that refers to the now superseded concepts, if any. The Quantities ontology should have been renamed SecuritiesQuantities and may or may not have been superseded by new content in the Securities or FBC domains. This is to be deprecated once no further legacy content makes reference to it.</skos:editorialNote>

The definitions for agents and parties in roles provide general, reusable patterns for talking about agents performing roles in specific contexts. For example the same person in the context of aviation could be a pilot, and in the context of family could be a mother.  These pattern will be refined in other FIBO ontologies to define concepts such as issuer, counterparty, underwriter, etc.</dct:abstract>

      <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Conventions</rdfs:label>
      <dct:abstract>The notion of a convention is widely used in securities models, usually in the form of code lists, for example for interest accrual conventions. This ontology sets out the basic notion of a published convention. For the same of simplicity, conventions that are not published by anyone specifically are treated as though published here by the EDM Council, thereby satisfying the ontology modeling rule that only codes that are published are considered real enough for inclusion in FIBO.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>This ontology sets out the basic notions of published information and the entities that publish this. 
		Note that there is a convention in FIBO that, since the ontology is intended to be a computationally independent representation of real things in the world, no information construct (such as identifiers) is considered real unless it is published by someone. This ontology provides the conceptual underpinning for this notion and may not be needed in application ontologies.</dct:abstract>

		This provides the conceptual underpinning for the notion that some published conventions are real because they are published in some standard, including FIBO itself. This model does not attempt to provide a detailed reflection of the standards process itself, it is merely the conceptual underpinning for the notion that certain codes and conventions are real because they are published in some standard.</dct:abstract>

Other categorizations are also possible based on probabilities or on differences in the kinds of events themselves. 
		Note that a risk event is generally an event that does not happen, so it will be beneficial in future work to make use of the extended sub-partitions of Occurrent to provide a clearer segregation across the model between actual events and mostly avoided or hypothetical events.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>This ontology sets out a complete range of concepts about time. The core of the ontology is based on the core concepts of instant and interval in the W3C Time ontology, while the scope and extent of the concepts are based on those concepts reflected in the FpML standard for time, calendar and schedule terms. This is a conceptual ontology and as such it makes a clear distinction between kinds of time and kinds of measurement or statement about time in calendars or data. 
		The Release ontology FinancialDates provides a more pragmatic and data friendly reflection of most of the concepts included in this Time ontology, for example by focusing on calendar and data statements about time as distinct from time itself. Properties that refer to concepts in this ontology are to be moved over to the corresponding concepts in that ontology, adding further concepts from this one where necessary. On completion of that work, this ontology may be deprecated. In the meantime parts of it may be deprecated when they are no longer referred to or were never referred to.</dct:abstract>

      <skos:editorialNote>The content in this module is original conceptual content and does not extend any other module. Some of the concepts represented conceptually in this module have been replaced by partial representations of some transaction concepts in the Products and Services module, sometimes using different labels for similar or equivalent concepts. Much of the content in this module will still be referred to in other FIBO domains, and care is needed in determining whether to replace these references to something in Products and Services versus when to bring forward more of the content in this module.</skos:editorialNote>

      <rdfs:label>Annotation Vocabulary</rdfs:label>
      <dct:abstract>This vocabulary provides a set of metadata annotations for use in describing FIBO ontology elements.  The annotations extend properties defined in the OMG's Specification Metadata Recommendation, in the Dublin Core Metadata Terms Vocabulary and in the W3C Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) Vocabulary, and have been customized to suit the FIBO specification development process.  

Note that any of the original properties provided in Dublin Core and SKOS can be used in addition to the terms provided herein.  However, any Dublin Core terms that are not explicitly defined as OWL annotation properties in this ontology or in any of its imports must be so declared in the ontologies that use them.</dct:abstract>

      <rdfs:label xml:lang="en">Values Ontology</rdfs:label>
      <dct:abstract>The Values ontology introduces a set of foundational classes that represent “values” as OWL classes where a value is an immutable piece of information without a specific lifetime or identity independent of the properties that have a value as their subject.  Subtypes of Value are intended to include semantic, business relevant classes that are not independent, mediating or relative things. 
While Values as defined here, in some cases, seem to replicate XSD data types they are intended to use, extend and build-on XSD data types for “business meaningful values”. 
Business meaningful values (which we will call “Business Semantic Values”) are things like amount, name, postal address, mass, duration, currency and metrics – concepts that make sense in the business domain and are the types of properties of business entities, but not they are not business entities in themselves.  These values are the type (range) of properties that represent the qualities and characteristics of the entities in our business domain such as people, places, transactions and financial instruments. In contrast to semantic values, primitive datatypes, such as “Real”, “Integer” or “String”, frequently have no business meaning on their own.
As the intent of the Value classes is to capture business meaning, the Value classes are not intended to be used directly in domain models. Subclasses of Value classes that capture business semantics are intended for use in domain models. In other languages, such as UML, this intent to only use subclasses is known as an “Abstract” class.</dct:abstract>

A product as defined here is something marketed and offered for sale, in this case a loan, such that when a customer takes on the product, they become signatories to a corresponding loan contract. A loan product in this sense is a contractual , off-the-shelf product with terms corresponding to those in the actual contract when it is signed.
		Note that considerable work has been done on products to support a separate loan product concept in the HMDA-derived Loan Contracts module, so this work now needs integrating with that or deprecating</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>This ontology provides concepts relating to secured loans. All loans are either secured or unsecured, and secured loans are secured either by collateral or by guaranty. 
		This ontology covers these core concepts, so that mortgage loans, where the collateral is more specific, can be built on to of this. These concepts may not be needed for stand-along application-specific ontologies for mortgage lending as the concepts here provide the abstractions for definition of mortgage loan concepts and differentiates them from other categories of loan. These intermediate abstracations may or may not be presented in the separate Loan Contracts module for mortgage loans.</dct:abstract>

		This ontology and much of the common supporting information on loan applications are based on extensive review and input from Sallie Mae in the US and there may be other variants of student loans that are not covered here. For example in principle a student loan may be framed as a credit facility in some arrangements and as a single loan with separate payment phases in others.</dct:abstract>

      <dct:abstract>Debt pricing and yields are intimately related, and this ontology sets out the basic concepts of debt price, including different ways in which debt and bod prices are described and calculated, as well as a range of different kinds of yield (simple yield, Wall Street Yield, Japanese Yield and so on). The pricing terms are supported by a range of trading and exchange related concepts that are used to differentiate different kinds of debt price, for example last, high and low exchange prices.
		Note that there seems to be some cross-over between terms in this ontology and in the Debt Analytics ontology, for example Macaulay’s Duration is here while modified duration is in the other ontology, and similarly some yield terms are in that other ontology. This was originally one single ontology, and these two ontologies should be used together.</dct:abstract>
