    <h2>FIBO</h2>
    <p>
<p><a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo">FIBO</a> is intended for a range of uses, including in its simplest form as an English language
Glossary or a bank or regulator's Data Dictionary. In its most
complex form, FIBO in its native Web Ontology Language (OWL), could be used as a bank's
operational ontology. There are also external uses of FIBO such as FIBO.schema.org
which uses FIBO as a reference for search indexing of specific information on the Internet. The <a href="fibo/doc/FIBO_Primer.pdf">FIBO Primer</a> provides a layman's version of what is FIBO and how to use its content.</p>
<p>To serve this wide array of users, FIBO is published quarterly on <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo">https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo</a>  as a
variety of products in file formats and dialects ranging from HTML to JSON-LD. All are generated, or derived from, the FIBO
OWL system of record using the <a href="https://spec.edmcouncil.org/fibo/doc/20170930_FIBO_BTDM.pdf">Build-Test-Deploy-Maintain Methodology</a> in a continuous
development process governed by automation including the Council-developed open source
RDF ToolKit, GitHub, Jenkins, SourceTree and a number of wikis for collaboration.</p>
<p>Each FIBO product is published in two releases:
<ul><li><b>FIBO Production</b> is published at the end of each calendar quarter and has
been vetted by SMEs and passed standard industry <i>hygiene</i> tests for OWL.</li>
<li> <b>FIBO Development</b> is published in real time as changes are incorporated
by the FIBO Leadership Team and consists of draft as well vetted content.</p> </li>
</ul>
<p>A list of all ontologies in FIBO and whether they can be found in the Production release or the Development release is available (<a href="fibo/index/infra-284/latest/OntologyIndex.csv">csv</a>, <a href="fibo/index/infra-284/latest/OntologyIndex.xlsx">excel</a>)
<p>The EDM Council welcomes and encourages participation from users and developers. But to
become part of the team, you will need to have a GitHub user (you can request to connect to FIBO using an existing user name) and you must request to have access to FIBO JIRA.
