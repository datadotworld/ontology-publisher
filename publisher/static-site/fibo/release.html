  <li><b>2018 Q2</b>
    <p><i>Highlights</i></p>
    <ul>

Primary changes this quarter include new regulatory reporting material, clean-up of open issues, elimination of informative/provisional content that was redundant or has been incorporated into released ontologies, and a revised metadata strategy to support several FIBO products such as FIBOpedia.  The work performed this quarter will help with integration of Level 2 GLEIF Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) support in Q3, as well as integration of equities and additional debt-related concepts in the Securities domain.

    <li>SEC-51  - eliminated restriction with respect to securities tax treatment in SecuritiesExt, which is largely about settlement, but where the tax details available in the tax treatment ontology were overly simplified and insufficient to provide utility; an independent effort with respect to taxation generally is needed eventually, once the FIBO community determines that it is a priority.</li>
